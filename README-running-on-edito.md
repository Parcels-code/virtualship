## Running virtualship on EDITO

Pixi needs to be installed on EDITO before we can run virtualship.

- Choose the "Jupyter-python-ocean-science" service
- In the "Init" section you can provide a script for initialisation
  - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Parcels-code/virtualship/refs/heads/edito-hackathon/ci/pixi-on-edito.sh`
- from there you can follow the contributing instructions available for virtualship

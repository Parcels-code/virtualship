    "# SURF Resarch Cloud: VirtualShip environment setup\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note: This guide is specific to students who are enrolled at Utrecht University.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the class, we will use VirtualShip in the cloud (in this case, SURF Research Cloud - called SURF RC from here-on). This has several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You aren't limited to the power of your laptop.\n",
    "- Everyone can work in the same collaborative environment.\n",
    "- The environment is pre-configured with all necessary software and dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Accepting SURF RC invite\n",
    "\n",
    "In your student email you'll have an invite from SURF Research Access Management (SRAM) to join a project on SURF RC. Accept this invite.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Open the workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to the [SURF Research Cloud Dashboard](https://portal.live.surfresearchcloud.nl/), and click \"access\" on the shared workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Open Terminal session\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Jupyter launcher, you should see an option to open Terminal session. Click this to open Terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Launch VirtualShip environment\n",
    "\n",
    "❗️ Before proceeding any further, you should type the following command in the Terminal: `bash` and then hit Enter. This will ensure that you are in a bash shell for the rest of the setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see that the Terminal prompt has changed to something like\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(base) metheuser@mywsp:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is conda telling you that you are currently in the \"base\" environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, you already have another environment set up for you. Running `conda env list` in the Terminal, you should see:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env list\n",
    "\n",
    "# conda environments:\n",
    "#\n",
    "base                 * /etc/miniconda3\n",
    "virtualship            /etc/miniconda3/envs/virtualship\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, to launch the VirtualShip environment, type the following command in the Terminal and hit Enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate virtualship\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will activate the VirtualShip conda environment, which has all the necessary dependencies installed. You can confirm that you are in the correct environment by checking that your Terminal prompt now starts with `(virtualship)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the `virtualship` environment, you now have access to the `virtualship` command in your Terminal, which can be confirmed by running `virtualship --help`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Navigate to the shared storage folder\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working from a shared storage folder in the workspace. To navigate to this folder, type the following command in the Terminal and hit Enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd data/virtualship-storage/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the specific set-up for the course you are taking, if you now enter `ls` to list the contents of the directory, you should see various group folders, for example: `group_1`, `group_2`, ... and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where will be working from for the rest of the course, with the group name for each folder corresponding to your assigned group.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are ready to continue with the VirtualShip analysis workflow as described in the course materials and/or VirtualShip [quickstart guide](https://virtualship.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/quickstart.html)."

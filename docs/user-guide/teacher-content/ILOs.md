# Aligned* learning outcomes
\* Using the revised version of Blooms taxonomy (Anderson et al. 2001)

1.	Identify practical challenges of planning sea-based research, such as:
-	Availability and capabilities of research vessels and equipment, e.g. ice breaker vessel needed, infrastructure for equipment available
-	General logistics, e.g. transportation of container labs and other equipment
-	Requesting permits
    -	Travel permits for staff
    -	Diplomatic clearance (EEZ) 
    -	Customs documents
-	Safety trainings (beforehand and onboard)
-	Preparing, testing and transporting equipment

2.	Be aware of (describe) matters during sea-based research, such as:
-	Contingency due to weather conditions and other unforeseen circumstances
-	The need to be flexible and patient
-	Taking notes, recording coordinates, stations, casts
-	Measurement protocols
-	Communication with crew, e.g. captain, winch driver
-	Living at sea, e.g. sea legs, seasickness, relaxation, water/energy/waste footprint

3.	Give examples of uncertainty and variability of sea-based observations, such as:
-	Likely errors or wrong values, and seeing the data through the noise
-	Time and date coordinates, e.g. UTC, local time, ship time
-	Variability and limitations of measurements
-	Different scales of variability, e.g. tidal, seasonal
-	‘Synopticity’ of measurements (i.e. not possible to measure with one ship at multiple locations at the same time; therefore mixing time and space variability)
-	 Instrument specific qualities, e.g. ADCP reflection

4.	Learn how to analyse and interpret sea-based observations. Be able to:
-	Read in different data formats, e.g. nc, csv, zarr
-	Manipulate arrays and other data structures in python
-	Create and interpret density/TS profiles
-	Create spatial temperature/salinity/velocity maps, do GIS things
-	Interpret plots and deduce ocean circulation
-	Report findings
-	Contribute to a cruise report with pictures or plots

5.	Plan a research cruise. Be able to:
-	Formulate research questions
-	Select sampling sites 
-	Consider the duration of deployments, e.g. time a CTD station takes
-	Decide on on-site measurement order
-	Plan rest/working shifts for scientific personnel
-	Deal with contingency, e.g. consider what sites/measurements are essential, which are ok to skip

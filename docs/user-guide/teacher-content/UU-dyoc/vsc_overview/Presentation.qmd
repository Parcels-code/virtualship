## ![](https://virtualship.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/virtual_ship_logo.png)

- **VirtualShip** provides an authentic experience of oceanographic expeditions anywhere in the global ocean. <br>
- As scientists, you will plan and execute an oceanographic expedition, analyse the resulting data and communicate your findings in a final presentation.

## Your expedition 🚢 {.smaller}

- Congratulations on receiving a student research grant for ship time on a virtual scientific research vessel!
- As a group you will:
    - Have access to the ship for a _maximum_ of three weeks and you can conduct your research anywhere in the global ocean.
    - Have access to a wide range of oceanographic instruments, including CTDs, ADCPs, Drifters, Argo floats, and more.
    - Be responsible for planning and executing your expedition.
        - Including submitting a proposal for your expedition, which will be reviewed by a panel of experts (i.e. the teachers).
    - Be expected to communicate your findings and experiences in a final presentation.
    - Write and submit a Code of Conduct for your group.

## The presentation {.smaller}

- As a group, you will create a slide-deck to present your expedition to the class and teachers.
- Your presentation should be 12 minutes long, and will be followed by a few minutes of Q&A.
- The presentation should include:
    - An introduction and motivation for your expedition.
    - A description of your expedition plan, what instruments you deployed and why.
    - A discussion of the challenges you faced during your expedition.
    - An analysis of your data, including computing derived quantities.
    - A discussion of the implications of your findings.
- The grade (30% of the course) is based on the slides and presentation (rubric will be provided).
    - The group grade is the average of that by the lecturer, the two VSC teachers, and the average of the peer students.
    - How the grade is divided between group members is based on Code of Conduct.

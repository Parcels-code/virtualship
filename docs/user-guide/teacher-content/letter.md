# Information for cruise participants

```{note}
The following information is not important for the VirtualShip expedition and exam but could be useful for your future career or the science communication article you might write.
```

**Safety and Security regulations:** Safety and security on board are paramount, and all cruise participants are required to follow a basic ‘Survival at Sea’ course prior to departure. A valid Medical Certificate is mandatory. Furthermore, additional safety instruction and training will take place on board at the beginning of each cruise. All participants must take part in this safety instruction. Safety is everyone’s responsibility. Failure to obey the rules can result in being expelled from the ship.

**Personal details:** To comply with international requirements, certain personal details of the persons joining the vessel are required. This includes passport information and personal information for immigration and customs when in foreign ports and information on food preferences and allergies for catering on board. Your passport will likely remain with the purser while onboard the ship.  

**Medical facilities:** The medical facilities onboard are very limited and depending on the cruise location it will not be possible to get assistance from shore-based doctors. Dietary restrictions needing special food products may be a problem as well due to limited storage space on board and working space in the galley. As a consequence, certain medical conditions and/or allergies cannot be accommodated on board. If you have listed medical conditions or allergies that pose a problem you will be contacted to discuss the issues.

**Onboard, cabin:** All cabins have their own private toilet (with toilet paper) and shower. On arrival on board, cabins should be found clean, with clean bedding and towels provided. Bring your own toiletries, toilet soap, medication, vitamins, sunscreen, etc. The sheets and duvet covers will be washed by the steward at the end of the cruise. During the cruise and before disembarkation, participants have to clean their own cabin and bathroom facilities. Please clean your cabin thoroughly before you leave the ship; the state of the cabin will be checked by the chief mate. For the washing of personal clothing and bedding, free laundry facilities are available on board.

**Onboard, meals:** the main meal is served during lunchtime. Breakfast will be Dutch standard. In the evening a hot snack will be served with the meal. Meal times are Breakfast: 07:30 – 08:00; Lunch: 12:30 – 13:00; Evening meal: 18:00 – 18:30. The tap water on the ship is safe for drinking. The ship provides tea, coffee, mineral water, soft drinks, fruit juice etc. For those working during the night, food can be made available at other times. Please discuss this with the cook well in advance. 
Alcohol policy: No alcoholic beverages are available onboard. It is also not allowed to bring your own alcohol for consumption on board.

**Smoking:** Smoking is prohibited inside the accommodation. The captain may, in close consultation with the chief scientist and the crew and if safety allows, appoint certain designated smoking areas on deck and in the accommodation at the start of every cruise.

**Cleaning equipment and lab containers:** Every science party has to make sure that the equipment and lab containers that were used during the cruise are cleaned thoroughly before leaving the ship. The next team is entitled to find equipment and labs in good working conditions.

**Dangerous goods on board:** Onboard, dangerous goods such as chemicals will be stored under the supervision of the chief officer. The dangerous goods lockers in the wet lab will be locked during port calls. All dangerous goods brought on board can only be transferred to the dangerous goods lockers in the presence of the chief officer, who holds the key. All dangerous goods need to be labelled properly, stating the name of the substance, the person responsible and the date when the substance will be taken off the vessel. Before the end of the cruise, the chief officer will check the dangerous goods lockers to make sure all items are removed as intended.

**E-mail, internet and telephone facilities:** Email size limitation is 5Mb. Please avoid sending large pictures or videos because this will clog up the system. An occasional phone call from the ship can be made free of charge. Please note that bandwidth-consuming applications such as WhatsApp calls or streaming of music and/or video is not permitted. These are essential steps to take before joining:
- Administrator Rights: Verify that you have administrator rights on your computer, as this is necessary for installing printers and changing network settings.
- Work Email Authentication: Ensure that your work email authentication is not reliant on SMS. Please have your institution’s authentication app (e.g., OKTA Verify, Microsoft Authenticator) installed and configured on your mobile device before departure.
- Password Expiry: Check the expiry dates of your passwords. It’s more convenient to update them while onshore, so try to renew them before you leave.

**Safety boots/safety helmets:** safety boots are mandatory while working on deck. Participants need to bring their own safety boots. Helmets are available on board and are to be worn during all hoisting activities on deck. Safety shoes cannot be worn inside the accommodation, so please bring comfortable footwear suitable for inside the accommodation.
Substance abuse: there is zero tolerance for drug abuse.

**Sexual harassment:** there is zero tolerance for any sort of harassment. In case of harassing situations observed, the chief scientist and the master are the contact person and confidential mediators. 

**Cruise summary report and cruise Report:** cruise summary and cruise reports are required for all cruises. In your case you might suffice with a presentation and uploading the slides. The chief scientist is responsible for providing copies for those countries that provided diplomatic clearance (as requested in the Notification of Diplomatic Clearance).
End of cruise duties: Make sure that all scientific work is stored, packed and labelled. Make sure that all goods to be shipped are prepared, properly packed and labelled. Clean labs and cabins before leaving the vessel.

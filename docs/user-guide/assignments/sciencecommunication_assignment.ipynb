    "### Assignment description\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will write a popular scientific article about the virtual expedition. \n",
    "    - This is an individual assignment.\n",
    "    - The length of the article should be between 700 and 1000 words. \n",
    "    - The audience of your science communication article are Physics BSc students.\n",
    "    - You need to include and refer to the findings/results of at least two recent scientific articles on physical oceanography (published after 2020) as background. \n",
    "    - For an example of the style you could use, check out [this article](https://physicsworld.com/a/20000-pings-under-the-sea/) (although at almost 3,000 words that article is way longer than expected here), or [this article](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/expeditions/to-hades-and-back-exploring-the-deepest-part-of-the-ocean/).  \n",
    "    - For this assignment, you can use AI for editing and feedback (AI level 3) for the text, and AI is fully permitted (level 5) to create photos of the expedition. You must include an AI disclosure statement (what tools are used and why) and it is required to keep a record of AI prompts used in the assignment. Oral examinations can be conducted on suspicion of non-permitted use of Generative AI. \n",
    "- Submit a first draft of the article to Blackboard by 18 March 13:00. \n",
    "- Every student will provide formative feedback for three other articles. Deadline is Monday 30 March 17:00. This formative feedback will be graded and will count 25% of the mark for this assignment.  \n",
    "- You will incorporate the formative feedback where appropriate into a final version of the article and submit that as a pdf on Blackboard by 2 April 17:00. \n",
    "- The articles will be graded by the lecturer and the Teaching Assistants.\n"

@article{Daniels2025,
 abstract = {Typical physical oceanography fieldwork involves boarding a research vessel and traveling to the open ocean for periods of up to several weeks. Such scientific research expeditions are expensive, time-consuming, logistically challenging, and therefore are not very accessible. We present design-based research about an alternative: a virtual fieldwork experience using the new VirtualShip Python package and accompanying lesson materials. Data are collected in two graduate courses using qualitative and quantitative methods, and include interviews, surveys, and grading rubrics to investigate students\’ learning outcomes and learning experience. We find that the virtual fieldwork was highly engaging, and students report on enhanced self-efficacy and knowledge. We conclude that student involvement and learning were boosted by using the Virtual Ship Classroom as an authentic learning environment.},

TITLE={Pangeo Forge: Crowdsourcing Analysis-Ready, Cloud Optimized Data Production},

JOURNAL={Frontiers in Climate},

VOLUME={Volume 3 - 2021},

YEAR={2022},

ABSTRACT={Pangeo Forge is a new community-driven platform that accelerates science by providing high-level recipe frameworks alongside cloud compute infrastructure for extracting data from provider archives, transforming it into analysis-ready, cloud-optimized (ARCO) data stores, and providing a human- and machine-readable catalog for browsing and loading. In abstracting the scientific domain logic of data recipes from cloud infrastructure concerns, Pangeo Forge aims to open a door for a broader community of scientists to participate in ARCO data production. A wholly open-source platform composed of multiple modular components, Pangeo Forge presents a foundation for the practice of reproducible, cloud-native, big-data ocean, weather, and climate science without relying on proprietary or cloud-vendor-specific tooling.}}

@article{Daniels2025,
 abstract = {Typical physical oceanography fieldwork involves boarding a research vessel and traveling to the open ocean for periods of up to several weeks. Such scientific research expeditions are expensive, time-consuming, logistically challenging, and therefore are not very accessible. We present design-based research about an alternative: a virtual fieldwork experience using the new VirtualShip Python package and accompanying lesson materials. Data are collected in two graduate courses using qualitative and quantitative methods, and include interviews, surveys, and grading rubrics to investigate students\’ learning outcomes and learning experience. We find that the virtual fieldwork was highly engaging, and students report on enhanced self-efficacy and knowledge. We conclude that student involvement and learning were boosted by using the Virtual Ship Classroom as an authentic learning environment.},
